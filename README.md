"The engineer has been, and is, a maker of history — James Kip Finch”

Engineering placement, also known as campus recruitment, is when companies come to your colleges campus, conduct interviews, and hire candidates to work in their company. These campus placements are arranged for by your college who invite all the best possible companies to recruit from their students. The campus placements are held before the final examination. These placements not only benefit the students, but they also benefit the companies and colleges.
However, as a student, you need to prepare well for the campus placements. Getting the best companies for the placement drive is the main job of your college.
The main objective of the campus placement activity is to get students a job right after they have finished their education. Since the campus placement is conducted before the final exam, students have an added incentive to do well in their final exam. Students are also under less pressure. Good placements also allow colleges to claim 100% placement which is an excellent form of advertising for them. Companies get to snatch up talented people who will do some great work for their business.

In this notebook, I will be performing a supervised prediction that classify whether the student would be placed or not based on the student’s "Stream", "HistoryOfBacklogs", and "CGPA". Also, We'll try to analyze and find insights from the data.
